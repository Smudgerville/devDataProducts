#### Overview

Using the `EuStockMarkets` data in the **utils** package, we provide a method for running [GARCH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_conditional_heteroskedasticity#GARCH) models from the **tseries** package on windows of time for the 4 major European stock markets.

#### Using this application

The application is on the **Model** tab in the navbar above.  Please read the instructions below on how to use the model before proceeding.  You can come back to these instructions at any point by clicking the **Documentation** tab.

1. First pick the date range you want to examine.
  - First choose a year and month, then a specific date
    - The input date picker defaults to an annual view first to facilitate greater time changes initially
  - Click outside the date picker to close the window
  - You may leave dates unchanged, or choose to alter only the beginning or end of the window of time being examined.
2. Choose which of the 4 European markets you would like to examine:
  - DAX: Germany
  - SMI: Switzerland
  - CAC: France
  - FTSE: UK
